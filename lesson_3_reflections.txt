When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to collaborate or simply share the work reflected in the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may have reasons for wanting to wait that Git could not know. You may not want to flood the remote with updates, especially if it isn't yours.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
q
    Branches are for taking the code in a different direction, trying out a new feature, making some change you aren't sure will work, etc. You can safely try these edits to the code base without breaking what you already have working.

    Clones are for getting started with an existing project. Perhaps you are working on a project started by someone else, or one you began elsewhere and need to continue working on at a different computer.

    Forks are similar to clones, but of repositories you may need permission to interact with. They are also good for twirling spaghetti.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can interact with the most up to date version of the project.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
